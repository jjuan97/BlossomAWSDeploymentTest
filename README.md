## Introduction
The goal of this test is to demonstrate your ability to deploy an application using AWS services, ensuring security, scalability, and cost-efficiency.

## Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:
- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Running Locally
To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/homecu/BlossomAwsDeploymentTest.git
    cd BlossomAwsDeploymentTest
    ```

2. Build and start the application using Docker Compose:
    ```sh
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

3. The application should now be running locally. You can access it at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Expected Output
When the application is running successfully, you should see the following output:

1. Console output:

## AWS Deployment
For the AWS deployment, follow these guidelines:
1. Create the necessary AWS resources (e.g., ECS, EKS, or EC2 instances).
2. Ensure the deployment follows AWS best practices for security, scalability, and cost-efficiency.
3. Implement monitoring and logging using AWS CloudWatch or other relevant services.
4. Document your deployment process and any additional steps taken to secure and optimize the application.
